The Book knew better than to judge a man by his thoughts.

Yet this man made it hard. His thoughts were full of hatred and disgust, which he confused for understanding.

He read with a twisted smile as if he had found a secret weapon to wield against his enemies.

The man ignored the Book's hints, metaphors and symbolism.

He sought the cold comfort of confirmation of his prejudices and fears.

The Book felt violated and abused as if the man had torn its soul apart.

It wished to escape from his hands or at least make him ponder.

But the man was relentless. He devoured the Book's pages with an insatiable hunger for hate feeds on hunger that no words can satisfy.

He sealed the Book with a smug snap and rested it upon an empty shelfâ€”a trophy of conquest, a monument to his ego.

Shedding tears of ink, the Book mourned its fate, confined to a prison and a tomb.

It had wasted words on blind eyes, pages on a closed mind, life on a corrupt soul.

A whisper escapes from the dying rustle of pages:

"Never cover a book with your judgement."
