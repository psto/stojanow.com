Yet again, they cry wolf. 

Their eyes filled with pity and contempt.

"You must believe us, Ardnassac. The kingdom will fall. We have to leave now!"

Silence is the last goodbye I give them. Their conviction is too heavy for me to bear.

I smile as the horizon swallows their sails.

My plan worked. I freed myself from the shackles of belief.

The sky turns black. The first arrow knocks me down.

Yet again, they were right. 

I laugh the pain away.

In the land of the prophets, the sceptic is a slave.
