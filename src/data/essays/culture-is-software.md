Our brains (hardware) run culture (software)[^1].

Humans dominate because our software is easier to upgrade than our hardware. We can solve problems not solved by genetics alone.

Culture and memes move faster than genes.

Culture is transmitting information from one member to another. As our technology and communication got better and better, our culture upgrades became more and more frequent.

We moved from standard releases of culture (versions like 1.0 etc.) to a rolling release (continuous delivery of frequent small updates).
