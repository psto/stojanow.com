Crossing the border, he closed his eyes.

His daughter's scream kept ringing in his ears.

"I can't stop."

The Abyss called his name.

"I must close the portal."

He felt his dead wife calling him.

"Get away from me!"

He heard himself shouting in the voice of the Abyss.

His eyes remained closed.

There was only darkness and unity.
